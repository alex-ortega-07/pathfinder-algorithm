# pathfinder-algorithm
My own implementation of a pathfinder algorithm.

## Usage
Select one option on the upper side menu bar of the application and start creating your distribution by clicking the left button on your mouse. In case you want to delete it, you can click the right button on your mouse once you are positioned on each square or press the `c` button on your keyboard to proceed to clear the grid. Press `g` on your keyboard to enable or disable the grid.
